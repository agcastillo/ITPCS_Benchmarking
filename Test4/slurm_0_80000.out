slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 4487454 ON udc-ba34-16c7 CANCELLED AT 2019-05-03T13:23:34 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[7629,0],0] on node udc-ba34-16c7
  Remote daemon: [[7629,0],2] on node udc-ba34-16c9

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
