slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 4487456 ON udc-ba34-16c2 CANCELLED AT 2019-05-03T13:34:35 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[32838,0],0] on node udc-ba34-16c2
  Remote daemon: [[32838,0],1] on node udc-ba34-16c5

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
